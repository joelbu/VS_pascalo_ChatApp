14. create an activity to generate a public-private key pair with java.crypto
    and to enter the username
    OK - Pascal - 2016-12-06

15. create a preference activity with two options to toggle sound and vibration for notification

2016-12-08:
    1. close app and open it again is not working --> no chats displayed
        - the own keys are still there --> maybe the reading of the addressbook is not working
        Fixed - Joel - 2016-12-10
    2. vibration is not working
        - OK - Pascal - 2016-12-09
    3. sound is not working :-)
    4. network configuration still missing
        Fixed - Joel - 2016-12-10
    5. store chats when new messages are added to it
        Done - Joel - 2016-12-9
    6. notification is not visible at all correct moments
        - clicking on it won't lead to the chat app MainActivity
            - OK - Pascal - 2016-12-09
        - symbol is not really well chosen <-- detail
        - notification does not disappear when the chat is opened
            - OK - Pascal - 2016-12-09
        - notifications are not displayed if chat is open and the app is "closed"/freezed with the home button
            - OK - Pascal - 2016-12-09
    7. i saw a lifecycle bug earlier but don't remember what it was
        - maybe this has something in common with the first point
        -- Probably, yes. I also found a null pointer exception on forgetting chats, which is fixed too
    8. perhaps we can avoid trying to read address book on first start, I think the filenotfound exception is rather slow
        - check if key is generated to know if we have to read the address book
            but how do we know if our keys are already generated they are stored in the address book, aren't they?
        -- I just made the File.exists() call instead of reading directly.
        -- Our own keys are in the address book, but the information about our keys existing is
             in a separate shared preference because it's read earlier and really just a flag
