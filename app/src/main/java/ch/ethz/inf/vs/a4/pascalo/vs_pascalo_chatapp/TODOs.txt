store chat messages per chat in a file named "cat_[chat partner name].???"
a little overhead but I think it's a lot easier to store and find them even we
have more overhead

I called the files chat_with_[UUID] instead, because everything is pretty much centered around
UUIDs and we do theoretically support different chat partners with the same name. We only have
checks if a UUID already exists when adding a new users. - Joel
